# 01.04_Deployment_Models

In cloud computing, the metaphor of the sky extends down to the different kinds of 'clouds' we can utilize. These are referred to as **Deployment Models**, and they're akin to selecting the right winds for your journey. There are four primary forms of cloud deployments: Public, Private, Hybrid, and Community. Let's venture into these types:

## Public Clouds ‚òÅÔ∏è

Public clouds are the most common form of cloud computing deployment. The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers and delivered over the internet. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. 

Generally, all customers share the same infrastructure pool with limited configurations, security protections, and availability variances. It's like cruising in a wide-open sky, with many other pilots.

Here's a simple example: if you're using AWS's S3 service for storing your application data, you're operating in the public cloud.

## Private Clouds üè∞

A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. This deployment offers versatility and convenience while preserving management, control, and security. It‚Äôs more akin to navigating through your own wide-open sky alone.

Here, businesses own, maintain, and operate their computing resources which could be located on the company‚Äôs on-site datacenter or hosted by third-party service providers. Either way, services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network, powered by software intended solely for one company's use, like a personal navigation satellite system.

## Hybrid Clouds ‚öñÔ∏è

Hybrid clouds are a combination of public and private clouds bound together by technology to share data and applications. They provide businesses the flexibility of the public cloud for basic and non-sensitive computing tasks and the security of the private cloud for critical operations, making it an ideal model for many businesses. They're like flying with a co-pilot, combining both your navigation prowess.

## Community Clouds üë•

Community clouds are a derivative of public clouds that cater to specific business communities with common concerns such as mission, security requirements, and policy and compliance considerations. They're built and managed by the organizations that also use them. It's like flying in formation, each navigation decision made with the harmony of the group in mind.

Imagine a scenario where a group of retail companies comes together to form a community cloud. They all have similar requirements when it comes to managing inventory, logistics, and online sales, so they pool their resources in a shared cloud.

With this understanding of different deployment models to choose from, you're better equipped to choose the one that best suits your needs, just like choosing the best wind currents for a trip. Remember each model forms part of the climate of cloud computing. Therefore, a sound understanding of each is crucial for any professional aspiring to master the art of navigating the cloud. ‚òÅÔ∏èüïπÔ∏èüåê
