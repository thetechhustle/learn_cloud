## 03.03 AWS RDS and DynamoDB 🗃️💡

Let's dive deeper into the vast sea of cloud computing and come face to face with two of AWS's powerful and scalable data store options: **Relational Database Service (RDS)** and **DynamoDB**. These services hold the treasure trove of your applications—data. 

### AWS RDS ✨🏦

AWS RDS is a managed relational database service. As a relational database, it arranges data in tables, giving you the flexibility to establish relationships across different data types. This feature has made relational databases, and thus RDS, a go-to choice for complex applications where data precision is paramount.

#### Setting up AWS RDS 💡👩‍💻

Setting up an AWS RDS instance may seem complex at first, but don't worry. It's like deciphering a treasure map; once you know the markings, you're set:

```python
import boto3

db = boto3.client('rds')

try:
    response = db.create_db_instance(
        DBInstanceIdentifier='mydbinstance',
        MasterUsername='dbuser',
        MasterUserPassword='password',
        DBInstanceClass='db.t2.micro',
        Engine='mysql',
        AllocatedStorage=5)
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

The AWS SDK for Python—Boto3 makes it astoundingly simple to manage AWS resources such as RDS.

### AWS DynamoDB 🏎️📦

AWS DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service—designed for applications that require millisecond response times and need to support millions of requests per second. While a relational database like RDS suits complex relations, DynamoDB is perfect when you need speed and flexibility.

#### Setting up AWS DynamoDB ☁️🏗️

Creating a DynamoDB table is as simple as stacking blocks. Let's look at the steps below:

```python
import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

table = dynamodb.create_table(
    TableName='mytable',
    KeySchema=[
        {
            'AttributeName': 'name',
            'KeyType': 'HASH'
        },
        {
            'AttributeName': 'email',
            'KeyType': 'RANGE'
        }
    ],
    AttributeDefinitions=[
        {
            'AttributeName': 'name',
            'AttributeType': 'S'
        },
        {
            'AttributeName': 'email',
            'AttributeType': 'S'
        },
    ],
    ProvisionedThroughput={
        'ReadCapacityUnits': 5,
        'WriteCapacityUnits': 5
    }
)
```

This piece of code does the trick here as well. With Boto3, you can easily spin up a DynamoDB table.

### So, which one to choose? 🧐

While both RDS and DynamoDB are essential parts of your AWS toolkit, the one you use depends on your specific needs. 

Think of it as choosing your vessel in an adventure: need to carry a lot of intricate treasures? The robust ship that is RDS will serve you well. But if you seek speed over water, even in high-wave scenarios, DynamoDB is your nimble jet ski.

With the capability to build complex data schemas, RDS elegantly handles transactional processes, just as a well-built disciplined crew handles the ship. However, if you're dealing with a high-throughput system that values flexible data structures, DynamoDB's efficiency reigns supreme!
