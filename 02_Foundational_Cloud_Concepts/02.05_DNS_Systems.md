## 02.05_DNS_Systems

#### Overview:

Often referred to as the "broadcast tower of the digital world," DNS (Domain Name System) Systems are the silent workhorses that keep the internet running smoothly. They transform domain names into IP addresses, guiding our digital communications to their rightful destination. To consider them as the 'GPS of the internet' would be apt. 🌐

#### What are DNS Systems?

Imagine you want to mail a letter to your friend. You need their exact postal address, right? Similarly, to visit a website, a computer needs to know its accurate Internet Protocol (IP) address. But it's not easy for humans to remember these numerical addresses. So, instead, we use domain names like 'google.com' which are much easier to remember.

Now, think of DNS as an advanced, intelligent postmaster. When you type 'google.com', the DNS system quickly translates that into the actual IP address, helping your computer find Google's servers. It's like looking up a friend's name in an address book to find their postal details. 📚 

This process, known as DNS resolution, involves multiple steps and several servers before it finally fetches the correct IP address for the domain name.

#### How Does DNS Work?

Let's break down the process into simpler steps:

1. When you enter a URL, your computer sends a request to the DNS resolver, which is typically run by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
2. The resolver then checks its cache for any previous requests to that URL. If found, it simply returns the corresponding IP address. If not, it asks other DNS servers for help.
3. The request is then passed on to one or more DNS root servers. These servers direct the query to TLD (Top Level Domain) servers, which maintain entries for domain names that share common endings like '.com', '.net', '.org', etc.
4. These TLD servers redirect the query to the authoritative DNS servers that store the actual IP addresses for specific domain names.
5. The authoritative server sends the IP address back to the DNS resolver and your computer finally connects to the desired website. 🌐💻

#### Why are DNS Systems Important?

Without DNS, we would have to remember the numerical IP addresses of every website we visit—an impractical and almost impossible task. DNS systems ensure we can seamlessly browse the web, send emails, stream videos, and more.

Further, DNS plays a vital role in load balancing, by distributing requests across multiple servers and promoting optimal performance and speed.

#### Getting Practical 

Now let's try to find the IP address of a website using the `ping` command in windows. Open your command prompt and type `ping www.google.com`.

You'll see something like

```
Pinging www.google.com [172.217.14.238] with 32 bytes of data: 
```

Here, `172.217.14.238` is the IP address of `www.google.com`.

#### The Cloud and DNS 

In cloud computing, DNS forms the backbone of service discovery—locating services and microservices across dispersed and interconnected components. A reliable DNS setup keeps cloud operations going, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted access to resources and services.

As your journey in the cloud continues, interactions with DNS will be frequent, often implicit. As you grasp networking and distributed system design, understanding DNS systems becomes even more crucial.

Remember, DNS is what keeps us from getting lost in the vast digital wilderness. With that understanding, your cloud environments will become more predictable, manageable, and efficient. You're one step closer to becoming a cloud whiz! 🎓✅
