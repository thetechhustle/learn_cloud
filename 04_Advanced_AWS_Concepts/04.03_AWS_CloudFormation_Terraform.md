# 04.03: AWS CloudFormation & Terraform

CloudFormation and Terraform are two potent weapons in a cloud engineer's arsenal. Let's explore them step by step.

## AWS CloudFormation üì¶
AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables developers to define and provision all the infrastructure resources in their AWS environment.

### Usage:
- Simple way to model a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, provision them quickly and consistently, and manage them throughout their life cycles.
- JSON or YAML-based text files that model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across regions and accounts.

Let's use an example to illustrate how you can use AWS CloudFormation:

```json
{
    "Resources" : {
        "MyTopic" : {
            "Type" : "AWS::SNS::Topic",
            "Properties" : {
                "Subscription" : [
                    {
                        "Protocol" : "Email",
                        "Endpoint" : "example@email.com"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This CloudFormation script creates a Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic with an email subscription.

## Terraform üèóÔ∏è
Like CloudFormation, Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently, but it's platform-agnostic.

### Usage:
- Helps create efficient, flexible, and reusable artifacts for reproducible infrastructure.
- Uses its proprietary language, HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), for scripts but it also supports JSON.

Here's a simplifying Terraform script example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

This script tells Terraform to create an AWS instance named "example-instance" in the US West (Oregon) region with the specified Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type.

üîë Remember, when using CloudFormation or Terraform, always validate your scripts and test deployments in a non-production environment first. Double-check everything before deploying to the production environment. Happy scripting! üöÄ
