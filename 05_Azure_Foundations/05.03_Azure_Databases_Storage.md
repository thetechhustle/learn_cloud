### 05.03 Azure Databases & Storage 

Embarking on our next segment of the route, let's span our wings into Azure's multitude of databases and storage options. These are crucial elements of Azure’s offerings, which power the core of many enterprise applications 📚💼. Just as a well-packed suitcase can make your journey easier, choosing the right storage solutions ensures that your data is safely stored and accessible whenever you need it.

#### 1. Understanding Azure Storage ☁️💾

Azure Storage constitutes a mix of services such as blobs, files, queues, tables and disks. These services are designed to cater to the diverse needs of modern applications - large scale data storage 💽, secure and durable archiving 🏦, data distribution to user end-points 🏍️, and much more.

Azure has a highly scalable and resilient architecture which allows data replication across various regions 🗺️ and protection against hardware failures.

We will discuss these services in detail now.

##### 1.1 Azure Blob Storage 🗃️

Blob storage is perfect for storing large amounts of unstructured data like images 📸, videos 📹, and logs 💽. It is economical, tiered, secure and can be accessed from anywhere over HTTP/HTTPS. Consider Azure Blob Storage as your giant filing cabinet in the sky!

```python
# Example: Creating a blob storage in Azure using Azure SDK for Python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(my_connection_string)
blob_client = blob_service_client.get_blob_client("mycontainer", "mytext.txt")

print("\nUploading to Azure Storage as blob:\n\t" + "mytext.txt")
with open("./sample.txt", "rb") as data:
    blob_client.upload_blob(data)
print("\nUpload completed!")
```

##### 1.2 Azure File Storage 📁

Azure File Storage provides traditional file shares 📂 over the network. This can be a seamless replacement for a standard file server in most scenarios. 

```powershell
# Example: Creating a file share in Azure using PowerShell
$ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccount -StorageAccountKey $key
$fileshare = New-AzureStorageShare -Name $newshare -Context $ctx
```

Now that you know about Azure storage and its two main types, blob and file, let's move onto the databases that Azure provides.

#### 2. Azure Databases 🗄️

Staying organized is critical during any journey, and databases are just the tool to cultivate organization and efficiency within your applications. Azure provides various database arrangements that address a broad range of requirements and use cases, whether it's a relational database 🪶, a NoSQL database 🗂️, or even a database for semi-structured data📈.

##### 2.1 Azure SQL Database ⚙️

Azure SQL database is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS). It provides high performance, secure and scalable service with built-in intelligence that learns app patterns and adapts to maximize performance and data protection.

```sql
/* Sample SQL statement to create a table in Azure SQL Database */
CREATE TABLE Customers(
CustomerID int PRIMARY KEY,
CustomerName varchar(255),
ContactName varchar(255),
Country varchar(255),
);
```

##### 2.2 Azure Cosmos DB 🌌

Azure Cosmos DB is a NoSQL database service that provides a globally distributed and horizontally scalable multi-model database service. With this, you can elastically and independently scale storage and throughput across any Azure region worldwide.

```csharp
// Sample C# code to create a container in Azure Cosmos DB
CosmosContainerSettings containerSettings = new CosmosContainerSettings("Items", "/id");
CosmosContainerResponse containerCreateResponse = await database.CreateContainerAsync(containerSettings);
```

This caps off our dive into Azure's options for storing data and information. As you get more familiar with these services and start using them, you'll find that databases 🗄️ and storage 💾 are as integral to cloud computing as passports are to travelers. Now, let's repack our virtual bags and take off to the next part of our Azure journey! 🚀
