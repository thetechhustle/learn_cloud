Azure is much more than mere 'cloud storage' or 'cloud services'; it's a robust platform to deploy and manage applications, infrastructure, and services in the virtual space, and even extends to physical computing devices in hybrid environments.

### What is Azure?

Azure isn‚Äôt a solitary thing. It‚Äôs a host of integrated cloud services used by IT professionals and developers to build, deploy, and manage applications via Microsoft-managed data centers. Integrated tools, DevOps, and a marketplace support you in efficiently building anything from simple mobile apps to internet-scale solutions.

### Components üõ†Ô∏èüß∞ of Azure

Azure is designed on several key building blocks:

- **Compute**: These services provide virtual machines, containers, and batch processing, alongside high-performance computing and the functionality thereby required.
- **Networking**: This category ensures private networks, dedicated connections, load balancing, DNS hosting, and traffic management. 
- **Storage**: These services provide scalable cloud storage for structured and unstructured data. It also supports big data projects, persistent storage, and archival storage.
- **Mobile**: This provides capabilities supporting back-end tasks for mobile app development, no matter the OS, and ensuring global access to them.
- **Databases**: Every type of database in the cloud‚Äîrelational, NoSQL‚ÄîAzure has all of it.
- **Web**: These services support the development and deployment of web apps and provide features for search, API management, content delivery, reporting, and more.
- **AI + Machine Learning**: This includes services providing a range of capabilities from machine learning to cognitive services to bot services.
