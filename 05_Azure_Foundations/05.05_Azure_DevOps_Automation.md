## 05.05 Azure DevOps & Automation 🧰🔄

Automation is the trusted co-pilot every cloud engineer needs aboard their digital flight, and Azure DevOps is the ace in your flight deck. This section unfolds how DevOps on Azure makes automated delivery a breeze, taking you from braving turbulence to cruising altitudes.

### Azure DevOps - The Essentials🎖️

Azure DevOps is a comprehensive toolkit, providing everything you need for efficient and reliable software delivery. It encapsulates everything from planning and tracking to code management, automated testing, and delivery. Let's break it down:

- Azure Boards🎯: Like a reliable navigator, Azure Boards aids in planning, tracking, and discussing work across the entire development effort.

- Azure Repos🔐: Think of Azure Repos as your cloud cockpit recorder system, capturing all version control for your codebase, helping you manage and store code efficiently and securely.

- Azure Pipelines🚀: Azure Pipelines is your fuel for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), enabling automatic build and test, speeding up and improving delivery to production.

### Azure Automation🔄

Azure Automation can be envisioned as the auto-pilot switch on your cloud flight deck. It provides the ability to automate frequent, time-consuming, and error-prone cloud management tasks.

Azure Automation serviceable utilities include:

- Process Automation🔄: Automate your cloud processes and routine management tasks, freeing your time for crucial strategic operations.

- Update Management🔄: Keep your system fully fueled and up to speed by managing updates across Azure, Windows, and Linux systems.

- Configuration Management🔄: Establish and maintain control over your cloud configuration, ensuring a seamless flight through your Azure sky.

### Case in point: Automating with Azure Runbooks📔

Azure Runbooks are at the core of Azure Automation service. Let's set one up:

1. Navigate to your Azure Automation account, select 'Runbooks' and then 'Create a runbook'.
   
2. Assign a name, select 'PowerShell' as Runbook type and click 'Create'.

```powershell
# You can introduce any powershell command here
Write-Output "Hello, Sky!"
```

3. Click 'Save', 'Publish', and then 'Start'. You just executed your first Azure Automation Runbook!

Mastering Azure DevOps and Automation is akin to becoming proficient in autopilot: it might take time and patience, but it's an indispensable tool for an effortless and efficient cloud journey! As you continue to hone your Azure skills, always remember: The sky's not the limit; it's just the beginning! 🚀✨.
